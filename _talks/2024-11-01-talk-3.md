Joint presentation with Dr. Audrey Dorélien examining partisan differences in the adoption of protective health behaviors during COVID-19 and modeling how these differences impact disease dynamics. Using detailed survey data on partisanship, contact rates, mask usage, and vaccination rates, we demonstrated that partisan differences in health behaviors exceed racial and gender differences. We incorporated these observations into a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model framework that explicitly incorporates partisanship to identify the most significant mechanisms driving disease spread, emphasizing the importance of considering partisan identification in public health policy and pandemic preparedness.
