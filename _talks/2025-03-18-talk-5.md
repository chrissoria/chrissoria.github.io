Presented as a Wonderfest "Science Envoy" at a public science event co-hosted with Marin Science Seminar. The talk explored how political partisanship significantly influences how different groups respond to public health guidance, affecting their adherence to protective measures against infectious diseases. Understanding partisan-based disparities in acceptance of scientific evidence helps us to predict the population-wide spread of diseases and to improve public health outcomes.

Wonderfest "Science Envoys" are early-career researchers with enhanced communication skills and aspirations, selected to communicate cutting-edge science to public audiences.
