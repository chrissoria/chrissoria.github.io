Joint presentation with Dr. William H. Dow examining the Hispanic health paradox in cognitive aging. The talk explored the contradiction in Hispanic aging where Mexican migrants, despite being more socioeconomically disadvantaged, demonstrate better cognitive aging outcomes than other Hispanic migrant groups. This research contributes to understanding health disparities and the complex relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in aging populations.
