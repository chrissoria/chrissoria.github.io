I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Demography from Berkeley, a journey I began four years ago. Now, with the flexibility to work remotely since I'm no longer taking classes, I've decided to live closer to my family and fiancé in San Diego. However, I still want to maintain my professional connections and enjoy the enriching environment Berkeley offers.

To make this balance work, I've opted for a small RV to facilitate my trips between San Diego and Berkeley. Initially, I parked it in a guarded lot in Oakland, but unfortunately, it was broken into. They stole items like the car battery and shower head—even my underwear!

Despite these challenges, I'm committed to making this RV adventure a success, documenting my experiences as I travel back and forth.

Today marks the first real "pilot" of this experiment, and I'm using this blog to document my journey from Oakland to San Diego. I'll share my favorite places to park and what I learn along the way. Once home, I'll make necessary repairs to make the RV livable.

# Staying while in the Bay
Last night, I stayed at Dumbarton Quarry Campground on the Bay. It's an excellent spot with running water, a camping store, and easy hookups. The people are respectful, and it's simple to park—important for me as I'm still getting used to driving the RV. The scenery is tranquil, with rolling green hills and the faint sound of the ocean. There's even Wi-Fi! Nearby are a Starbucks and other restaurants.

This location is perfect for visiting the Bay Area and getting to Berkeley easily. However, it takes about two hours to reach campus: a 45-minute bike ride to the nearest BART station, a 30-minute BART ride, and then a walk. Despite the distance, it's convenient, safe, clean, and affordable—a stress-free option compared to worrying about break-ins or parking issues.

Overall, while the travel time is a downside, the peace of mind makes it worthwhile when I need a reliable place to stay.

# My Holy Rules of Where to Park
The drive from San Diego to the Bay Area is quite the journey—about 8 hours long! For those not familiar with California's vastness, this might come as a surprise since it doesn't even cover the entire state.

# The Holy Rules of Parking System
To make this RV adventure feasible and enjoyable, I've established some essential criteria for parking spots:

1. **Cheap**: If it's not affordable, the whole experiment loses its purpose. Driving up and down the coast needs to be cost-effective compared to flying and staying in hotels.
2. **Convenient**: Proximity to civilization is crucial for emergencies and access to essentials like internet and charging stations for my laptop.
3. **Safe**: Peace of mind is non-negotiable. I need to feel secure wherever I park.
4. **Scenic/Cool Stuff Nearby**: To make the journey worthwhile, the spot should offer beautiful views or be close to interesting activities.

My ranking system assigns a maximum of 5 stars with these weights:

1. **Cheap** (weighted 0.9)
2. **Convenient** (weighted 0.8)
3. **Safe** (weighted 1.6)
4. **Adventurous** (weighted 0.7)

## Gilroy

My first stop on the drive down is Gilroy, CA—famous for its garlic festival where you can find everything from garlic fries to garlic ice cream! It's also home to the Gilroy Outlets, featuring discounted brand stores like Nike and North Face, and Gilroy Gardens, a charming place with unique plants and rides. While I'm not a rollercoaster fan, it could be a fun stop with my girlfriend. For a more relaxed vibe, there's Old Gilroy with its city hall that looks like a blend of Spanish deco and classic California.

### Parking in Gilroy

Following my holy rules, I've identified some promising parking spots:

- **Starbucks and Walmart Area**: This location (geolocation: 37.006523, -121.548415) offers free parking and proximity to essentials like Starbucks and Walmart—perfect for chilling and working. It's also near Costco for gas and snacks. While it seems relatively safe, it's not as secure as a designated RV lot since someone could potentially tamper with my stuff when I'm away.

Although not particularly scenic, I enjoy the serenity of the farm backdrop. For activities, San Ysidro Park is a short 7-minute bike ride away—not overly exciting but pleasant enough. Old Gilroy is about a 12-minute bike ride, offering more to explore.

Overall, this spot checks off most of my rules: it's affordable, conveniently located, and reasonably safe—though not quite a scenic paradise!

This parking spot gets the following rankings:

1. **Cheap**: 5 out of 5
2. **Convenient**: 4.5 out of 5
3. **Safe**: 4 out of 5
4. **Adventurous**: 3 out of 5

Giving it an overall score of 4.15 (this score differs from a simple average because it weights according to the most important factors to me).
