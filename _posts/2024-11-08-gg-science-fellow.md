I have been selected as a Libby Fee Science Fellow by the Greater Good Science Center.

Greater Good is a free online magazine published by the Greater Good Science Center that transforms scientific research into accessible content for a happier life and a more compassionate society. Originally launched as a print publication in 2004, it transitioned to an online-only format in 2009 to expand its reach and sustainability. The magazine bridges the gap between scientific journals and everyday life, offering practical applications for various audiences, including parents, educators, business leaders, and healthcare professionals. With millions of annual readers, Greater Good provides a diverse array of award-winning content, including articles, videos, quizzes, and podcasts, featuring contributions from renowned authors and researchers in the field of positive psychology and well-being.

In addition to its online magazine, Greater Good offers a range of online tools and courses to help individuals apply scientific insights to their daily lives. The organization also produces "The Science of Happiness," a biweekly podcast hosted by UC Berkeley psychologist Dr. Dacher Keltner. Each episode features a guest trying a positive psychology practice known to enhance well-being, improve relationships, foster compassion, or reduce stress. The podcast combines personal experiences with scientific explanations, providing listeners with both practical applications and theoretical understanding of happiness-boosting techniques.
