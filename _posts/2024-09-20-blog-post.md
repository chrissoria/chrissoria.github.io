I have been selected as a Science Envoy for Wonderfest: The Bay Area Beacon of Science.

Established in 1997, Wonderfest’s Mission is to inspire and nurture a deep sense of wonder about the world. Wonderfest programs — including public science gatherings in the San Francisco Bay Area and online science discourse & video — aspire to stimulate curiosity, promote careful reasoning, challenge unexamined beliefs, and encourage life-long learning.
