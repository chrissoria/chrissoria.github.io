This first ever blog post is in honor of my recently passed little man, Charlie the cat, who for 12 years went together with me through thick and thin. He was the best cat anyone could've asked for, and no other will ever be able to replace him. I will miss you dearly, Charles, aka "Chester." I love you always.

Charlie the cat, August 26th-September 6th. Rest in Peace.
