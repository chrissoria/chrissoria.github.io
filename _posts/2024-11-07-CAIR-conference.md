I had the opportunity to present our research on public school background and probability of enrollment in a graduate degree at the 2024 CAIR conference.

This project is in collaboration with <a href="https://matthewstenberg.com/">Matthew Stenberg</a>, <a href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/staff/sara-quigley/">Sara Quigley</a>, <a href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/staff/catherine-madsen/">Catherine Madsen</a>, and <a href="https://bse.berkeley.edu/lisa-garc%C3%ADa-bedolla">Lisa Bedolla</a>.

Our analysis of 12,307 graduate school applications reveals that the share of admissions committee members with public degrees significantly increases admission probability, while factors like community college attendance and having a master's degree decrease chances. Interestingly, while being from an underrepresented minority group, being older, not identifying as male, and having California residency all positively impact admission odds, attending a public undergraduate institution alone shows no significant effect on graduate school admission.
