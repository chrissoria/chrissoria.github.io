I recently presented my research at the Science Envoy "Ask a Science Envoy" event at HopMonk Tavern in Novatoâ€”my first time presenting at a brewery and to a non-academic audience. The experience taught me the importance of navigating sensitive topics like partisanship and belief in science, especially when audience members began debating the subject.
