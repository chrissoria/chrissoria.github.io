I presented shared work with Professor William Dow and Henry Dow, comparing sociodemographic characteristics of older Hispanic adults in U.S. immigrant populations with those in their countries of origin, using census microdata and the American Community Survey (publication pending).

I also spoke on a panel organized by the \href{https://www.facebook.com/PRBdata/photos/-ai-is-a-powerful-intriguing-new-tool-in-the-demographers-toolbox-how-can-we-har/1091739696325276/?_rdr}{Population Reference Bureau} with others utilizing AI for demographic research. The panel discussed using Large Language Models for data categorization and theme extraction, best practices, and whether these models are ready to replace human annotators in these tasks (paper pending submission).
