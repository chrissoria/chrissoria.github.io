On July 1st, 2025, I had the opportunity to present joint research with Dr. William H. Dow, Professor of Health Policy and Management and Director of the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at UC Berkeley. Our presentation explored a fascinating contradiction in Hispanic aging: the Hispanic health paradox in cognitive outcomes.

## The Paradox

The Hispanic health paradox has long puzzled researchers in demography and public health. Despite facing significant socioeconomic disadvantages—including lower income, less education, and reduced access to healthcare—Hispanic populations, particularly Mexican migrants, often demonstrate better health outcomes than would be predicted by their socioeconomic status alone.

Our research extends this paradox into the realm of cognitive aging. We found that Mexican migrants, despite being more socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to other Hispanic migrant groups, show better cognitive aging outcomes. This finding challenges conventional assumptions about the relationship between socioeconomic status and cognitive health in later life.

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding this paradox has important implications for:

1. **Health Disparities Research**: It challenges us to look beyond traditional socioeconomic indicators when studying health outcomes
2. **Public Health Policy**: It suggests that protective factors beyond income and education play crucial roles in cognitive health
3. **Aging Research**: It highlights the need to consider cultural, social, and migration-related factors in cognitive aging studies

## Potential Explanations

While our research documents this paradox, several potential mechanisms may explain these patterns:

- **Selection Effects**: Healthier individuals may be more likely to migrate, creating a "healthy migrant" effect
- **Social Networks**: Strong family and community ties may provide protective cognitive benefits
- **Cultural Factors**: Dietary patterns, lifestyle practices, and cultural values may contribute to cognitive resilience
- **Return Migration**: Less healthy individuals may return to their countries of origin, creating a "salmon bias" in observed outcomes

## Moving Forward

This research is part of my broader dissertation work examining how social networks shape cognitive health and dementia in aging populations. By understanding the mechanisms behind the Hispanic health paradox in cognitive aging, we can better identify protective factors that may benefit all aging populations, regardless of background.

The collaboration with Dr. Dow and the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging allows us to bring together expertise in health economics, demography, and aging research to tackle these complex questions about health disparities and cognitive aging.
