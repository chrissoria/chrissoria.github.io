I'm a Demographer and Sociologist pursuing my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as a data manager for The Caribbean-American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS) under Professor William Dow, and collaborating with Professor Claude Fischer on a project analyzing mobility within and between regions using data from the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study (UCNets). I'm also currently working alongside professors Dennis Feehan, Ayesha Mahmud, and Audrey Dor√©lien on a project aiming to understand how partisanship and social context impacted health behaviors during the pandemic using data from the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study (BICS). 

Research Streams
======
My research is rooted in understanding the roots of inequality of various outcomes in health, mortality, and education in the US setting. Additionally, I'm currently exploring the ways  Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment the survey data collection and analysis process. Reach out to me at ChrisSoria at Berkeley dot edu if you have any questions.

Social Network Determinants of Health and Cognitive Aging
------
I'm focused on studying how our social connections influence our health and the aging of our brain. My main goal is to separate the impact of feeling lonely from the effect of being socially isolated. Additionally, I want to explore how strengthening these social connections can potentially slow down brain aging. I also aim to investigate the effects of various types of social interactions, like those with close contacts versus new ones, on cognitive health.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
