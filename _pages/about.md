Chris Soria is a PhD candidate in Demography at the [University of California](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/graduate-students/christopher-soria/#:~:text=Demography%20PhD&text=Chris%20Soria%2C%20a%20PhD%20candidate,and%20dementia%20in%20aging%20populations.), Berkeley, where he studies how social networks shape cognitive health and dementia in aging populations.
His [NIA F31-funded](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/kHoWAniqj0iJsgXgWI3_mQ/project-details/11071776) research uses causal inference methods to examine how personal relationships and network structures influence cognitive aging and health disparities across diverse social contexts.
His work has been presented at the Population Association of America (PAA), the American Public Health Association (APHA), and the Pacific Sociological Association (PSA), and published in the American Journal of Epidemiology and The International Journal of Aging and Human Development.

Soria also develops computational tools that augment social science research using large language models.
After encountering challenges analyzing open-ended survey responses in his research, he created [CatLLM](https://pypi.org/project/cat-llm/)—an open-source Python package that enables researchers to apply language and vision models to survey coding, image analysis, and data categorization without machine learning expertise.

Background
------
I was born in Watsonville, CA, the son of an immigrant from Durango, Mexico, and grew up in Salinas. For my undergraduate studies, I attended City College of San Francisco as a sociology major, then transferred to UC Berkeley, also as a sociology major. I am currently a Demography PhD candidate at UC Berkeley.

Personal
------
Outside of his academic pursuits, Soria's personal interests reflect an appreciation for literature, nature, and his home state of California. A devoted fan of John Steinbeck, with whom he shares a birthplace, Soria particularly cherishes "East of Eden" as his favorite work by the author. His love for exploration extends to hiking and discovering lesser-known areas, often accompanied by his pet dogs, Gus and Bentley. At home, Soria's enthusiasm for nurturing life has led to a veritable jungle of houseplants. In his spare time, he stubbornly persists in playing chess, his strategy best described as "optimistic confusion." Each game serves as a humbling reminder that his true talent lies in creatively losing pieces rather than channeling Magnus Carlsen.
