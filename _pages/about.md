I'm a Demographer and Sociologist pursuing my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as a data manager for The Caribbean-American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS) under Professor William Dow, and collaborating with Professor Claude Fischer on a project analyzing mobility within and between regions using data from the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study (UCNets). I'm also currently working alongside professors Dennis Feehan, Ayesha Mahmud, and Audrey Dor√©lien on a project aiming to understand how partisanship and social context impacted health behaviors during the pandemic using data from the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study (BICS). 

My research is rooted in understanding the roots of inequality of various outcomes in health, mortality, and education in the US setting. Additionally, I'm currently exploring the ways  Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment the survey data collection and analysis process. 

Social Network Determinants of Health and Cognitive Aging
------
I'm focused on studying how our social connections influence our health and the aging of our brain. My main goal is to separate the impact of feeling lonely from the effect of being socially isolated. Additionally, I want to explore how strengthening these social connections can potentially slow down brain aging. I also aim to investigate the effects of various types of social interactions, like those with close contacts versus new ones, on cognitive health.

Internal US Migration
------
I'm currently assisting professor Claude Fischer on a project using data from the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study (UCNets) on a project aimed at gaining a better understanding of the causal predictors of internal US mobility.

Partisanship and Health
------
Our goal is to gain a better understanding on how political party affiliation impacts health behaviors, and how these differences contribute to the spread of disease. A collaboration with Audrey Dorlien, Ayesha Mahmud, and Dennis Feehan.

Inequalities in the Education System
------
A project aimed at understanding the biases in graduate school admissions that may be contributing to inequality. A collaboration with Matthew Stenberg, Sara Quigley, Catherine Madsen, and Lisa Bedolla.

Utlizing Large Language Models for Assisting the Research Process
------
A personal project of mine focused on how Large Language Models (LLM's) can help augment the research process.
