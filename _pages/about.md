Chris Soria is a PhD candidate in Demography at the [University of California](https://www.demog.berkeley.edu/graduate-students/christopher-soria/#:~:text=Demography%20PhD&text=Chris%20Soria%2C%20a%20PhD%20candidate,and%20dementia%20in%20aging%20populations.), Berkeley, where he studies how social networks shape cognitive health and dementia in aging populations.
His [NIA F31-funded](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/kHoWAniqj0iJsgXgWI3_mQ/project-details/11071776) research uses causal inference methods to examine how personal relationships and network structures influence cognitive aging and health disparities across diverse social contexts.
His work has been presented at the Population Association of America (PAA), the American Public Health Association (APHA), and the Pacific Sociological Association (PSA), and published in the American Journal of Epidemiology and The International Journal of Aging and Human Development.

Soria also develops computational tools that augment social science research using large language models.
After encountering challenges analyzing open-ended survey responses in his research, he created [CatLLM](https://pypi.org/project/cat-llm/)—an open-source Python package that enables researchers to apply language and vision models to survey coding, image analysis, and data categorization without machine learning expertise.
