Background
------
I was born in Watsonville, CA, the son of an immigrant from Durango, Mexico, and grew up in Salinas. For my undergraduate studies, I attended City College of San Francisco as a sociology major, then transferred to UC Berkeley, also as a sociology major. I am currently a Demography PhD candidate at UC Berkeley.

Personal
------
Outside of his academic pursuits, Soria's personal interests reflect an appreciation for literature, nature, and his home state of California. A devoted fan of John Steinbeck, with whom he shares a birthplace, Soria particularly cherishes "East of Eden" as his favorite work by the author. His love for exploration extends to hiking and discovering lesser-known areas, often accompanied by his pet dogs, Gus and Bentley. At home, Soria's enthusiasm for nurturing life has led to a veritable jungle of houseplants. In his spare time, he stubbornly persists in playing chess, his strategy best described as "optimistic confusion." Each game serves as a humbling reminder that his true talent lies in creatively losing pieces rather than channeling Magnus Carlsen.
