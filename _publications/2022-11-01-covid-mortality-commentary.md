As of July 2022, the cumulative, confirmed COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States and India were roughly 3,000 and 370 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively. COVID-19 mortality in India has been referred to as the "Indian death paradox" because the death rate is disproportionately low relative to the number of COVID-19 cases the country experienced. This commentary examines two evidence-based and plausible explanations of India's low death rates: demographic dynamics and factors contributing to increasing divergence in COVID-19 mortality in the U.S.
