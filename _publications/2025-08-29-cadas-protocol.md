The Hispanic Caribbean region is rapidly aging but national population-based aging surveys are rare. The Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS) is a multi-purpose household study of aging with a particular focus on the life course determinants and consequences of health and dementia in three countries with many similarities but divergent recent histories: Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba. CADAS will survey population-based samples of adults ages 65 and over. In Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic these will be nationally representative samples of 1,500 adults each; the Cuban survey will include 1,500 adults from purposively selected urban and rural areas.
